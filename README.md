Chat-Knows is an intelligent question-answering service based on a local knowledge base. It leverages document vectorization and vector search techniques to provide accurate answers to questions and reference relevant documents.

## üìíIntroduction

Chat-Knows combines knowledge and information from unstructured document collections with the ChatGPT conversational model to deliver more accurate and relevant responses. The system workflow is as follows:

- Allows you to chat with uploaded documents in formats such as PDF and Word using GPT capabilities.
- Intelligently divides the documents into smaller chunks and utilizes a powerful deep averaging network encoder to generate embeddings.
- Performs a semantic search on the content of the uploaded files, passing the most relevant embeddings to the LLM.
- Generates precise responses, including references to the sources of the information, which increases the credibility of the responses and helps quickly locate relevant information.

## üîßFeatures

- Document Upload: Upload unstructured documents to the Chat-Knows repository.
- Vectorization: Convert uploaded documents into numerical vector representations.
- Vector Search: Efficient vector search and relevance ranking based on the vectorized document collection.
- ChatGPT Interface: Integration with the ChatGPT model to provide answer retrieval and access to reference documents.
